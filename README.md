# Image-Deconvolution-using-the-Wiener-Hunt-Method
This project showcases image deblurring using the Wiener-Hunt method. It simulates blurring with a Gaussian Point Spread Function and restores the image by applying a frequency-domain filter to minimize noise and recover details. The results highlight effective deconvolution for enhanced image clarity.
